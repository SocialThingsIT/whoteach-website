On October 20, 2025, WhoTeach took part in the Third Investor Day promoted by **I-NEST – European Digital Innovation Hub**, an event held on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Almacube and dedicated to digital innovation.  
The event took place at the **DAMA Technopole in Bologna**, home of the **Leonardo supercomputer**.  
Our participation allowed us to present the WhoTeach platform to an audience of investors, companies, research centers and institutions, within a high-tech pitch competition.

## The third edition of I-NEST Investor Day

The Third Investor Day is part of the initiatives promoted by **I-NEST**, one of the 13 Italian European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) recognized by the European Commission and the Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy.  
I-NEST’s mission is to support startups and SMEs in strategic sectors such as digitalization, Artificial Intelligence, High Performance Computing and Cybersecurity, offering tailored services ranging from business plan development to access to EU funding and technological experimentation through Digital Enterprise Points (PID).

The Investor Day was organized by **Almacube**, the incubator and Innovation Hub of the University of Bologna and Confindustria Emilia Area Centro, which celebrated its 25th anniversary during the event.

WhoTeach was selected to participate, gaining the opportunity to present its project, connect with industry experts and access a qualified network of investors.

WhoTeach is a digital learning platform that uses AI components based on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing to help training institutions and companies create and deliver high-quality online courses with fewer resources.  
The platform includes two innovative modules for corporate learning:

- **Recommender System**: suggests personalized learning content based on each user's profile, needs and behavior
- **Generative AI**: creates learning materials, quizzes and multimedia content via prompt, enabling rapid and scalable course creation

Michele Lorubio moderated the pitches featuring WhoTeach, 3dto.me, Linee Bus, Visidea and **Daidalos**, which won an €8,000 grant for the most promising project.

**Daidalos** is a semiconductor IP company that designs and licenses ready-to-integrate accelerator cores. Its mission is to make advanced computing accessible and efficient for sectors like HPC, automotive, IoT, defense and aerospace. Unlike traditional chip manufacturers, Daidalos offers modular IP blocks enabling clients to integrate acceleration technologies into their devices, reducing development time, costs and risks.

## Content, panels and institutional contributions

The event featured institutional moments, keynotes and high-level thematic panels.  
Sanzio Bassini, Director of the SCAI Department at **CINECA**, delivered a keynote on Italy’s HPC and AI infrastructure for science and innovation within the European supercomputing landscape.

Following this, Francesco Morgia from the **MIMIT** (Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy) discussed public strategies supporting technology transfer and the growth of innovative companies.

The two central panels explored key themes for startups and digital companies:

- **Incubators and accelerators** (equity-free and equity-based), with contributions from H-FARM, Bugnion, Adaptronics and FNDX, moderated by Shiva Loccisano
- **Open Innovation**, moderated by Prof. Matteo Vignoli (University of Bologna), featuring Barilla, Chiesi Farmaceutici, Dinova and Philip Morris MTB, discussing how major corporations integrate solutions developed by startups and research centers

## Conclusion

The DAMA Technopole in Bologna, with its advanced infrastructures and the Leonardo supercomputer, provided the ideal setting for the Third I-NEST Investor Day — a valuable opportunity to connect with institutions, investors, universities and companies shaping the technological and industrial landscape of the country.

Being selected by I-NEST as a high-potential startup allowed WhoTeach to engage with deep-tech startups, accelerators, corporate stakeholders and innovation leaders.  
We gained strategic feedback, expanded our networking opportunities and initiated potential collaborations with industrial and financial partners.
