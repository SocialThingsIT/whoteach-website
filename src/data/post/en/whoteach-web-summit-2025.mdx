From November 10 to 13, 2025, Web Summit 2025 was held at the Feira Internacional de Lisboa, gathering over **70,000 participants** from around the globe and confirming itself as one of the world’s most influential tech innovation events. For four days, the Portuguese capital became a meeting point for startups, investors, big tech players, research centers and institutions — offering a packed program of conferences, workshops, pitch competitions and networking activities.

This year’s edition placed strong emphasis on **generative artificial intelligence**, cybersecurity, health technologies, industrial transformation, sustainability and the future of digital work.  
A broad lineup of talks and vertical panels explored upcoming trends in the tech sector, while the exhibition areas hosted hundreds of startups from over 100 countries — including WhoTeach, an Italian company specializing in AI-powered digital learning solutions.

## Everything that happened at Web Summit 2025

The 2025 edition brought together thousands of professionals, investors and startups in an international environment rich in inspiration, discussion and opportunity.

The program skillfully balanced vision and practicality, alternating high-profile keynotes with technical sessions, workshops and business-focused moments.  
Investors gained direct access to startups in seed, early-stage and growth phases, while founders and scaleups engaged with mentors, experts and potential partners through pitches and curated meetings.  
The energy of the event and the quality of exchanges reinforced Lisbon’s role as a leading European innovation hub.

Italian participation went well beyond booth presence: numerous startups competed in major challenges, including the finals of the **KPMG Global Tech Innovator 2025**.  
Winner: **Rhinoflux** (Japan), with an innovative hydro-chemical looping technology for CO₂ capture and storage.  
Other recognitions included Selection Lab (Netherlands) with the People’s Choice Award, and Akara Robotics (Ireland) and Step Out (India), ranked first and second runners-up.

Underscoring Italy’s significant presence, the opening ceremony of the Italy Pavilion featured Ambassador Claudio Miscia and Antonio Lucarelli from ITA Milan.

Web Summit also set a new attendance record:  
**71,386 visitors and 1,857 investors**, a **+74% increase** from the previous year.  
Among the **2,725 startups**, AI was the dominant sector, followed by SaaS, healthtech, fintech and sustainability-focused solutions.  
Institutional participation was strong as well, with 268 government delegations and over 400 themed meetups fostering discussions on emerging regulations and new market opportunities.

Keynote speakers included:

- Maria Sharapova (athlete)
- Toto Wolff (Formula 1 Team Principal)
