Training can no longer be limited to delivering information: today, it must create memorable experiences capable of engaging, inspiring, and truly transforming learners. This is precisely where Learning Experience Design (LXD) comes into play — an approach to training that places people at the center, studies every detail, and prioritizes empathy and interaction.

A joint study by Purdue and Roosevelt University applied this very approach: teachers trained in LXD workshops saw significant increases in engagement, emotional connection, and learner motivation. In other words, training stopped being a simple transfer of content and became a transformative experience.

And what’s the recipe? A good course isn’t enough — you need emotion, contextual alignment, micro-interactions, continuous iteration, all driven by empathy for the learner. That’s how the classroom becomes a journey, not just a lesson.

At WhoTeach, we see this every day: we strive to make our courses not just materials to scroll through, but meaningful experiences that stay with learners.

## Why Learning Experience truly captures (and keeps) attention

Think of those corporate courses that go by without leaving a trace. LXD acts as a spark: it takes training from “let me just get this done” to something engaging, emotional, and memorable.

According to a Purdue + Roosevelt study, teachers who adopted LXD saw learners become more involved, more motivated, and more connected: it wasn’t just instruction — it was transformation.

What makes such an experience so powerful?

- **A tailored context:** from start to finish, everything is designed to create a lasting memory.
- **Empathy at the center:** colors, narratives, and interactions crafted to make learners feel “seen.”
- **Continuous iteration:** the course grows and adapts based on real needs — it’s never static.

The result? Training that sticks, creating real connections between those who teach and those who learn. In university workshops, LXD increased motivation and strengthened relationships — training became an emotional experience, not a sterile one.

The concept of LXD connects closely with LXP (Learning Experience Platforms), which we explored in our corporate e-learning article.

## 6 strategies to turn LXD into a concrete project (even in companies)

You’ve understood what makes a learning experience memorable — now let’s explore how to make it real with a simple, strategic approach.

### 1. Observe, prototype, improve

The heart of LXD is a creative, iterative cycle — just like design thinking:  
Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test.  
A rigid process isn’t needed — what matters is gathering real insights and turning them into authentic solutions.

### 2. Use the Learning Experience Canvas

Imagine a single board containing everything: objectives, actors, emotions, scenarios.  
This is the Learning Experience Canvas by Niels Floor — a visual tool that makes design shared, fluid, and manageable.

### 3. People at the center

Creating personas or empathy maps isn’t a formality — it’s essential to understanding learners’ motivations, fears, and needs.  
This is how design becomes centered on the learner, not on self-referential content.

### 4. The stages of the LXD process

- **Empathize & define:** understand who the learner is through interviews or observation.
- **Ideation:** create ideas for engaging activities.
- **Prototyping:** build quick concepts — slides, short videos, or simple simulations.
- **Testing & iteration:** let users try prototypes and refine based on feedback.

It’s a creative loop, not a straight path — flexibility, listening, and innovation are essential.

### 5. Empathize and define: walk in the learner’s shoes

The first step is truly understanding who your learner is. Interviews, observations, or even simple conversations help uncover fears, motivations, desires.  
It’s like walking in someone else’s shoes: you understand what frustrates them, what excites them.  
Tools like empathy maps or personas make these insights visible, shareable, and — above all — useful in designing content that truly resonates.

### 6. Ideate, prototype, test: concrete + fast + smart

Once you’ve listened, it’s time to act. Brainstorm ideas for relevant, engaging activities.  
You don’t need a massive 100-slide course — a quick draft is enough: a slide, a 30-second video, a mini-simulation. Share it with learners, get feedback, refine, and repeat.  
It’s classic design thinking, LXD-style.  
Low-fi prototypes help you understand if you’re on the right track long before finalizing the full course.

## Beyond slides: the experience that makes learning stick

By the end of this journey, one thing becomes clear: a learning experience isn’t just a course — it’s an emotional, cognitive, and contextual pathway designed to stay with learners and generate real results.

A thoughtful design process can transform concepts and activities into experiences that motivate, engage, and support learner growth.

WhoTeach embodies this vision: every day, we strive to create an ecosystem that goes beyond simple content delivery.  
We work on integrated LMS solutions, advanced virtual classrooms, generative AI for slides and quizzes, and intelligent recommender systems.  
Our goal is always the same: to support the creation of personalized, engaging, measurable learning experiences.
