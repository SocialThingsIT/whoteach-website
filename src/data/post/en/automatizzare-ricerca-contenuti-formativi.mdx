Anyone working in training knows this well: today the problem isn’t the lack of content—it's the lack of time to distinguish what is truly valuable.  
Courses, articles, videos, podcasts, newsletters… the web is overflowing with information. But the gap between **quantity** and **quality** often translates into hours spent searching, opening, and evaluating resources.

### The risk?

Offering outdated, irrelevant, or redundant materials.  
Meanwhile, valuable time is lost—time that could be devoted to building more targeted learning paths or engaging people more effectively.

So, what if an intelligent system could handle _part_ of the work for you?  
No, this isn’t about automating everything. It’s about delegating the most repetitive part of the process to tools that help you search better, faster, and more accurately.

Let’s take a look.

## Tailored learning without starting from scratch

According to the **LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report 2025**, 94% of Italian HR leaders consider skill development a strategic priority, and 64% of companies will increase investments in upskilling and reskilling over the coming months.

But investment alone is not enough.  
To turn learning into a real competitive advantage, you need to make informed choices, build coherent and personalized learning paths, and avoid getting lost among folders, files, platforms, and scattered catalogues.

This is exactly why we at WhoTeach developed an **AI-powered Recommender System**: a tool designed to simplify the selection of training content by improving both speed and quality.

The system interprets the didactic context, considers discipline, objectives, difficulty level, and keywords, and automatically suggests relevant internal or external resources ready to be added to training courses.

It does not replace the role of HR, trainers, or teachers—it **supports** them by reducing operational workload and leaving more room for strategic design and instructional quality.

## How the WhoTeach Recommender System works

The WhoTeach Recommender System comes into play when building or updating a course.  
Its use starts with a simple configuration phase where the user enters key information such as:

- course discipline
- relevant keywords
- type of material (videos, articles, quizzes, exercises…)
- difficulty level
- other useful instructional parameters

Based on these inputs, the system analyzes the resources available within the user’s platform and, when useful, external compatible sources.  
It then returns a list of potentially valuable resources to enrich, complete, or structure the course.

The goal is not to offer generic content but to identify materials that **match the defined didactic characteristics** and can be adapted to the organization’s or instructor’s specific needs.

This allows course designers to avoid starting from scratch or searching manually through dozens of items: the system provides operational support, simplifying access to relevant, high-quality content.

## Conclusion

Today, anyone involved in training faces a concrete challenge: finding the right content at the right time without wasting hours on scattered searches.

Tools like the **WhoTeach Recommender System** are designed to support exactly this process.  
By leveraging parameters such as discipline, keywords, difficulty level, and content type, the system suggests internal or external resources to consider when designing or updating a course.

It’s an operational support that enables faster, more targeted, and more coherent work—enhancing existing content and making it easier to integrate new resources when needed.
